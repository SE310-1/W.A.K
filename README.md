# W.A.K
W.A.K aims to create a movie tracker web-app developed to simplify and enhance the movie-watching experience while making this process more fun and customisable.

# What does this project do?
The app's primary goal is to help users keep track of the movies they have watched. Our app will provide features such as movie ratings, reviews, and the ability to create shared lists with friends. It aims to be a user-friendly and feature-rich app that caters to movie enthusiasts.

# Why is this project useful?
We want to offer a seamless way to organise, discover, and enjoy their favourite films. We also want to make this experience as personalised as possible. We plan to achieve this with many new features, like adding the chance to change the theme based on the user's favourite movie and adding custom rating labels for shared lists rather than the same old five stars.
